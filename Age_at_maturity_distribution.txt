OpenBUGS code and data for obtaining an age-at-maturity distribution for female snapping turtles based on minimum and maximum ages at maturity for known-aged females. 

Model {

	# Priors
	mu.log ~ dnorm(0,0.1)		# mean of log-normal distribution
	sd.log ~ dunif(0,1)		# SD of log-normal distribution	
	tau.log <- pow(sd.log,-2)	# convert SD to precision		

	# Sample data
	for (i in 1:n) {		# for each female...
		x.c[i] ~ dlnorm(mu.log, tau.log) I(min[i],max[i])	# sample age at maturity from log-normal distribution
		x[i] <- round(x.c[i])					# convert to discrete age
	}

	# Generate posterior distribution for age at maturity
	x.new.c ~ dlnorm(mu.log, tau.log)	# generate continuous distribution 
	x.new <- round(x.new.c)			# convert to discrete distribution
}
